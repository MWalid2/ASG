# Code Book

This code book describes the variables, data, transformations, and cleaning performed in the `run_analysis.R` script for the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" project.

## Variables

-   `subject_id`: Identifier of the subject who performed the activity.
-   `activity_id`: Identifier of the activity performed.
-   `activity_name`: Descriptive name of the activity.
-   Various other variables represent mean and standard deviation measurements for different features. These variables are named following the pattern: `mean_{feature_name}`.

## Data

The data used in this project are sourced from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset. The data includes accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The dataset contains information about subjects, activities, and various features derived from sensor data.

## Transformations and Cleaning

1.  The training and test datasets are read and merged.
2.  Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted.
3.  Descriptive activity names are used to label the activities in the dataset.
4.  Variable names are appropriately labeled with descriptive names.
5.  A second tidy dataset is created, containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
