# Human Activity Recognition Data Analysis

This repository contains the `run_analysis.R` script that performs data analysis on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset. The dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartphones. The script `run_analysis.R` performs the following steps:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to Run the Script

1. Download the dataset from the [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extract it.
2. Place the `run_analysis.R` script in the same directory as the extracted dataset.
3. Open R or RStudio and set the working directory to the location of the script and dataset.
4. Run the script using `source("run_analysis.R")`.
